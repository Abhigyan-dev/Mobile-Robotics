    "In genral, ICP doesn't always give the coorect alignment because of the noisy depths associated with the Lidar calculations. Even after assuming ideal non-noisy position coordinates the ICP alignment may not always work. The ICP relies heavily on the orthogonal procrustus alignment which relies on the correspondences between the two set of points. If the corresponsences are correct, the proctrustus would give us the answer in just one iteration, however if its not the correct one, the absolute error wouldn't have gone to close to zero values. Here, the absolute error remains much larger than the tolerance, hence we run the algorithm once again and repeat the process. At every ICP iteration, we perform a nearest neighbor search. What that does is basically for each point int set_2 it tries to find its nearest neighbor in set_1, this way by assuming the correspondences we apply the procrutus alignment. Therefore if the correspondences are nerver matched properly we will never get the correct alignment. After trying out a few testcases, we have noticed that when the either the bunny's orientation or its location is changed by a significant amount, it becomes very difficult for the bunny to get aligned to the desired orientation  but its *position still gets aligned pretty well*. This misalignment in orientation arises due to a certain *local minima in the error value* which forces the procrustus alignment to not change it significantly because no small change in the rotation matrix can give a lower error value than the one already achieved and in order to reach the perfect alignment (error = 0), the alignment must first increase the error value and then decrease to the global minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the normal ICP algorithm each point in one data set is paired with the closest point in the other data set to form correspondences. Then a point to point error metric is calculated in which the sum of the squared distance between points in each correspondence pair is minimized. The process is iterated until the error becomes smaller than a tolerance value or it stops changing. On the other hand, in *point to plane ICP*, the error metric minimizes the sum of the squared distance between a point and the tangent\n",
    "plane at its correspondence point, the figure uploaded in the results folder can be referred for more clarity on the geometry. Although each iteration of the point to plane ICP algorithm is generally slower than the point to point version, it has been observed the *convergence rates are faster* in the former, which is why it is so widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genralized ICP is an algorthm which aims to combine the Iterative Closest Point and the point to plane ICP algorithms into a single probabilistic framework. This framework is then used to model the locally planar surface structure from both scans instead of just one scan as done in the point to plane algorithm. This can be realized as a plane to plane ICP. The new approach is shown to have outperformed both the standard ICP and the point to plane ICP approaches. In addition to being *more robust* to incorrect correspondences, outliers, and noisy measurement depths, it has demostrated an *improved performance* level and can also *incorporate probabilistic models* while maintaining the normal ICP's speed and simplicity."
